<p className="fs-3 light-blue">The Precision Pandemic Health Surveillance (PPHS) system is Asiaâ€™s first city-wide mixed source wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2. In Bangalore, the system has been conducting systematic and regular testing of wastewater since April 2021. A total of 45 open canals and 28 sewershed sites are covered at intervals of one - two times a week. This covers almost 70% of the total population of Bangalore. On June 21, 2021, the platform also introduced genome sequencing to determine the prevalent and dominant strains. This effort is possible through strong inter-agency collaboration between BBMP, BWSSB, KUWSDB, Pollution Control board, DoHFW and partners.</p>
